Erica Roe,"Licensed Psychoanalyst, MA, LP", ,(845) 289-8377,"In my experience, difficult emotions, such as sadness and anger, are often replaced with expectations. They can come from family, partners, jobs and social media, and can paint a particular picture that can alienate the wide range of emotions a human may feel.  These expectations often leave us feeling lost and alone. In order to develop genuine, creative relationships with others and ourselves, we must find a way to safely experience all of our emotions.
